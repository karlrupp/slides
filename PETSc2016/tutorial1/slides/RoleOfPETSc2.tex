\Large You want to think about how you decompose your data
structures, how you think about them globally. [...]

If you
were building a house, you'd start with a set of blueprints
that give you a picture of what the whole house looks
like. You wouldnâ€™t start with a bunch of tiles and say.
``Well I'll put this tile down on the ground, and then I'll
find a tile to go next to it.''

\medskip

But all too many people try to
build their parallel programs by creating the smallest
possible tiles and then trying to have the structure of
their code emerge from the chaos of all these little
pieces. You have to have an organizing principle if
you're going to survive making your code parallel.
